# Very-Simple-Electron-Simulator-in-Processing
This code is to simulate the arrangement of electrons in an atom, specifically to try to simulate the element chlorine. The number of electrons in the atom is randomly generated as a float between 1 and 28 and then rounded down to the nearest integer. The number of electrons in each of the atom's shells (inner, middle, and outer) is then determined based on the total number of electrons. The positions of the electrons in each shell are calculated using trigonometry, and the electrons are drawn on the screen using the ellipse() function. The code also draws circles passing through the electrons in each shell. code by avhishaan.
